Use runner.m to do all actions it calls both Gauss_Naive.m and Gauss_pivoted.m and compares the normalized out put of both. And prints to the terminal which performed better or if the output is the same. It also prints the normlized values of both methods.

n is initally set to three, and the formating is long.
