
# Project 1:

Use runner.m to do all actions it calls both Gauss_Naive.m and Gauss_pivoted.m and compares the normalized out put of both. And prints to the terminal which performed better or if the output is the same. It also prints the normlized values of both methods.

Tested with n set to 10000.

  The Naive Gaussian Elemination had a larger normilized value.
  The Naive Gaussian normlized value:		 1.009412e+04 
  The Pivoted Gaussian normlized value:	 1.009412e+04 

n is initally set to three, and the output formating is set to long.

Output is formated to line up.
